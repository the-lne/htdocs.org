        This site doesn't really serve a purpose, I just wanted to make a website.
        Downloads, documentation, random projects, etc of mine are stored here.
        You can contact me at admin@htdocs.org. I can't send emails to major email 
        providers like gmail and yahoo until I setup a google relay server. This 
		is my test, did the git pull origin main work?
