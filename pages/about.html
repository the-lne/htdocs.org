          This site doesn't really serve a purpose, I just wanted to make a website.
          Downloads, documentation, random projects, etc of mine are stored here.
          You can contact me at admin@htdocs.org. I can't send emails to major email 
          providers like gmail and yahoo until I setup a google relay server.
